# Contentful Local Date UI Extension

This is a UI extension for Contentful which sets dates to your local timezone without having to worry about time changes.*

## Status

This is currently a proof of concept. It is working but could use more testing and some usability adjustments.

\* Unless youâ€™re working with dates in the far future or your country decides to change their time zone on short notice.
